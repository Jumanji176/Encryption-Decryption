# Encryption/Decryption
This is a basic encryption and decryption program made in python.  
The program can encrypt/decrypt single line sentences or paragraphs in the terminal.  
  
# Note:
Please do not use this to actually encrypt your data.  
It has been made for fun for showcasing the most simplistic method of encryption.  
There are more powerful encryption programs out there, this is not one of them.  
If you do however want to use this to encrypt files or data of personal information, please don't, this offers zero protection of data.
